## Trump Tweet Frequency
If you're interested in how many times a day Trump tweets, you can reference the CSV or JSON files that group tweets by day going back to 2009. 

I won't be updating these files (latest date is 3/23/2019), so if you'd like up-to-date numbers follow the instructions below to run the script.

## requirements
- node v8.6.0 or higher (haven't tested with lower versions)

## setup
- `npm i`

## use
- `node index.js`

## result
- running the script will overwrite the existing JSON and CSV files (ignore the moment JS warning)
